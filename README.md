# HASS.IO Configuration
**Pertinent files from my Home Assistant config**<br/><br/>
:warning: **This does not include all files necessary to have my configuration working, just the important ones; everything else should be customized to suit your individual setup** :warning:

* Starting with version 1.0.0b0 configuration has completely changed, be sure to follow this updated readme.
* This is a major update from previous versions and everything should be considered a breaking change.
* This card should now be "type: module" in your lovelace resources.
* Update manually if updating from a version lower than 1.0.0b0.
* The compact-custom-header.lib.js file is no longer used and can be safely deleted.
